## About
This is a quick script, that will generate a nested table of contents, the links to each heading. Just paste in the contents of your markdown document, and results will be coppied to your clipboard.

Why? Currently Dev.to doesn't automatically generate a table of contents for blog posts. For longer articles, this makes it hard for users to quickly find a specific section. It should work with any markdown content, like GitHub readmes, blog posts, documentation, etc.

## Deployment
It's just a static HTML page, so serve it with any web server, CDN or static host.<br>
There's a demo hosted on GH Pages, at: [lissy93.github.io/md-toc-generator](https://lissy93.github.io/md-toc-generator/)
